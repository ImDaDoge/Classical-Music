							<h3>How the <i>Devils' Thrill</i> came to be</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/devil.jpg" alt="Liszt" width="400" height="500" /></span> From poetry to artwork to cinema and beyond, dreams have inspired masterpieces; think of Poe’s The Raven, Dali’s The Persistence of Memory, and Nolan’s film Inception.</p>


							<p>While an artist waking up inspired isn’t new, artists being haunted into creation always makes for an interesting story. Such is the case with Giuseppe Tartini’s Violin Sonata in G Minor. Famously known as the Devil’s Trill Sonata, the piece came about after Tartini dreamt he made a deal with the devil for his soul (Dorian Grey style). After handing his violin over, the devil played a sonata so beautiful and enchanting that Tartini was left breathless and woke up, vowing to recreate what he had heard. After putting quill to parchment Tartini came up with this spectacular piece, a fiendishly difficult challenge for even the most accomplished of performers. Although Tartini considered The Devil’s Trill his best composition, he always felt it never quite compared to the flawless masterpiece he heard the Devil play in his dream. </p>
