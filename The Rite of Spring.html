							<h3>How <i>The Rite of Spring</i> came to be</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/igor.jpg" alt="igor" width="400" height="500" /></span> Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring is a dramatic masterpiece – the irregular musical energies and abstraction of Russian folk tunes make this work buzz with a frenetic virtuosity you can’t help but get swept up in. The ballet and orchestral work created in 1913 is presented in two parts ‘Adoration of the Earth’- a pagan celebration of Spring, and ‘The Sacrifice’, wherein a young woman dances herself to death. The plot behind the music in itself is dramatic and thrilling, but sometimes fact is more interesting than fiction. </p>


							<p>The premiere of The Rite of Spring at the new Théâtre des Champs-Elysées was a riot (and we mean that in the most literal sense). Heckling from the audience began from the very beginning of the performance – they became so loud that the ballet dancers couldn’t hear the orchestra and Stravinsky himself fled backstage. A brawl followed (there’s even some witnesses who say someone was challenged to a dual) and police were called. So, what caused all the fuss? Was it the music, a turning point of class conflict, or the choreography? There are so many accounts that point in different directions we may never know. </p>
